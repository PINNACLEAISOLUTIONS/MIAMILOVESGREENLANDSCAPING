## 🔬 Horticultural Expertise (South Florida Context)

### 1. Tropical Soil Management

Miami sits on a limestone base (Miami Oolite). This leads to **high pH (alkaline) soils** which often cause micronutrient deficiencies in non-native plants.

- **Our Solution:** We implement chelated iron and manganese treatments to prevent "yellowing" (chlorosis).
- **Organic Amendment:** We use custom compost blends to increase Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) in sandy coastal soils.

### 2. Palm Specialization (Arboriculture)

We manage the most prestigious palm species with surgical precision:

- **Bismarckia Nobilis (Silver Bismarck):** Requires massive spacing and specific potassium fertilization to prevent frond drop.
- **Pseudophoenix sargentii (Sargent's Cherry Palm):** Rare, slow-growing, highly salt-tolerant for beachfront estates.
- **Pest Strategy:** Preventative systemic drenching for **Spiraling Whitefly** and **Lethal Bronzing (LB)**. We use truncated pruning (never "hurricane cuts" which weaken the crown).

### 3. Native & Xeriphytic Gardens

For eco-conscious luxury, we design using Florida Natives:

- **Specimen Trees:** Lignum Vitae (Holywood), Gumbo Limbo (Copperwood), and Satinleaf.
- **Drought Tolerance:** Utilizing Simpson's Stopper and Silver Buttonwood for screening that requires 40% less water than traditional Ficus.
